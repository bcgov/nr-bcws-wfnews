A Restricted Area Order, or area restriction, is a legal document administered through a local Fire Centre by the Ministry of Forests.
It is put in place to prohibit access to areas where there are ongoing fire suppression activities occurring, to limit the risk of wildfire occurring or to address a public safety concern.
Restricted Area Orders are established to enforce the continued need to protect the public and emergency service personnel in active wildfire areas.

When a Restricted Area Order is established under section 11(2) of the Wildfire Act, a person must not remain in or enter the restricted area without the prior written authorization of an official designated for the purposes of the Wildfire Act, unless the person enters the area only in the course of:

- Travelling to or from his or her residence;

- Using a highway as defined in the Transportation Act;

- Travelling through or entering the area as a person acting in an official capacity that is connected or involved in incident operations; OR

- Travelling through or entering the area for a purpose approved by an official of supporting wildfire suppression activities.
