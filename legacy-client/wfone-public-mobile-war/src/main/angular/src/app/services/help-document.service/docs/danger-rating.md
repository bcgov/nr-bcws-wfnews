The B.C. Danger Rating System is applicable to generalized forest fuel types for making site specific decisions.
The systems used in designing the B.C. Danger Rating System are the Canadian Forest Fire Behavior (FBP) System and Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) system.
These systems are designed to be used either singly or in combination other factors to aid wildfire management decisions, including wildfire prevention and pre-suppression levels.
There are many ways to adapt the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System components for provincial use, depending on the objectives desired.
For British Columbia, with its diversity of fuel types, climate, and topography, the objective of a danger rating system is best met by broadly classifying the relative magnitude of the wildfire control problems.
The B.C. Danger Rating System uses wildfire occurrence and relates that to FWI values to provide guidance for landscape activities.

### Definitions

- **Very Low**: The amount of dry forest fuels are limited and are at a low risk of catching fire.

- **Low**: Fires may start easily and spread quickly but there will be minimal involvement of deeper fuel layers or larger fuels.

- **Moderate**: Forest fuels are drying and there is an increased risk of surface fires starting.
Carry out any forest activities with caution.

- **High**: Forest fuels are very dry and the fire risk is serious.
New fires may start easily, burn vigorously, and challenge fire suppression efforts.
Extreme caution must be used in any forest activities. Open burning and industrial activities may be restricted.

- **Extreme**: Extremely dry forest fuels and the fire risk is very serious.
New fires will start easily, spread rapidly, and challenge fire suppression efforts.
General forest activities may be restricted, including open burning, industrial activities and campfires.
