Becoming wildfire resilient is a shared responsibility across BC.
FireSmart and its seven disciplines is an all-encompassing program, extending from the individual homeowner level, to the community and out onto the landscape.
FireSmart principles have shown that they are effective at reducing the risk to life and property in the most extreme wildfire conditions.
The FireSmart program is backed by a vast amount of field, laboratory, and wildfire modelling research.
Its methods help reduce the risk of losses under even the most extreme fire conditions.
