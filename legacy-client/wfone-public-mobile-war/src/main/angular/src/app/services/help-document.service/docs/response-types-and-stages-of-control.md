Incident Response Types and Stages of Control are key operational terms within the BC Wildfire Service. 
They are used to discuss and report on incidents, and to manage wildfires.

### Wildfire Response Type

- **Full Response**:
The wildfire requires immediate initial attack and/or sustained suppression action until the fire is declared “out”.

- **Modified Response**:
The wildfire is managed using a combination of suppression techniques, including direct and indirect attack, and monitoring to steer, contain or otherwise manage fire activity within a pre-determined perimeter (to minimize costs and/or damage and to maximize benefits from the fire).

- **Monitored**:
The wildfire is observed and assessed to determine the appropriate response option to minimize social disruption and/or significant impacts on values and resources, while achieving beneficial ecological, economic or resource management objectives.

### Wildfire Stage of Control

- **Wildfire of Note**:
A wildfire that is highly visible or poses a potential threat to public safety.

- **Out of Control**:
A wildfire that is continuing to spread and is not responding to suppression efforts.

- **Being Held**:
A wildfire that is not likely to spread beyond predetermined boundaries under current conditions.

- **Under Control**:
A wildfire that will not spread any further due to suppression efforts.

- **Out**:
A wildfire that is extinguished. Suppression efforts are complete
