The majority of wildfires in British Columbia are responded to by three-person initial attack crews.
When a wildfire grows beyond initial attack resources, 20-person unit crews perform sustained action.
The type(s) of initial attack crew deployed to fight a wildfire depend on a variety of factors, including location, terrain, size and fire behaviour.
The BC Wildfire Service has two types of specialized initial attack crews: parattack crews and rapattack crews.

- **Initial attack crews**:
Initial attack firefighters operate as part of a three-person crew and are usually the first on scene of a new wildfire.
Once there, the initial attack crew works quickly to set up water pumps, remove fuel from the fire’s path and dig fire guards to control or extinguish the blaze.
There are about 390 BC Wildfire Service initial attack firefighters stationed throughout the province, strategically placed in areas of high fire danger or high fire activity.
Initial attack crews are highly mobile and are often relocated to help fight wildfires throughout the province.

- **Unit crews**:
Unit crews operate in 20-person packs and are specialized to perform sustained action when a fire has grown beyond initial attack resources.
Unit crews establish pump and hose lines, dig fire guards, burn off fuel from the fire’s path, and use chainsaws to cut fuel breaks and remove danger trees.
There are 30 unit crews throughout the province of B.C.; and like their initial attack counterparts, unit crews are highly mobile and can be called away to work in areas of high fire activity.
For wildfires in remote locations, or those which require a high level of response for an extended period of time, unit crew personnel may live in a temporary fire camp and work for 14 days in a row.

- **Parattack crews**:
Parattack crews are an initial attack resource consisting of smokejumpers who are capable of responding anywhere in the province within two hours.
Parattack crews are trained to parachute from fixed-wing aircraft, called Jumpships, to fires in hard-to-access locations.
Using a fixed-wing aircraft, as opposed to the conventional helicopter response, allows for more personnel and equipment to be transported faster and over greater distances.

- **Rapattack crews**:
Rapattack crews are an initial attack resource capable of quickly responding to wildfires that occur in areas that are hard-to-access by foot or by vehicle, and where there are no suitable landing areas for helicopters nearby.
Rapattack crews normally rappel from rotary-wing aircraft (i.e. helicopters) in order to perform initial attack fire suppression action.
