### Relative Humidity

Relative humidity tells how much water vapour is in the air, compared to how much it could hold at that temperature.
For example, a relative humidity of 50% means the air is holding one half of the water vapour it can hold.
The lower the relative humidity, the more rapid a wildfire will start and burn; the more vigorously a wildfire will burn.

### Wind Speed

Wind speed is the velocity of the wind (in km/h) at the weather station.
The reported wind speed is measured at 10 meters above the ground and is a 10 minutes average wind speed.
As it is an average there will be gusts that exceed that speed.
Wind speed plays an important role in helping removing moisture from forest fuel and pushing a flaming front of a wildfire.

Wind is the result of differences in atmospheric pressure, caused by differences in air temperature and density.
Wind is a major element of the fire weather environment.
It largely determines a fire's rate and direction of spread.

### Wind Direction

Wind direction is defined as the direction the wind is coming from.
If you stand so that the wind is blowing directly into your face, the direction you are facing names the wind.
Wind direction are reported in degrees (X°) with North being 0°, East 90°, South 180°, and west 270°.

### Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)

The Fine Fuel Moisture Code is a numeric rating of the moisture content of litter and other cured fine fuels.
This code is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuel (surface litter, leaves, needles, small twigs, etc.).
The range of the values is 0-101.

- FFMC 85-88 ignition probable
- FFMC 88-91 ignition will occur, spotting will occur in upper range
- FFMC +92 extreme fire behaviour possible

### Duff Moisture Code (DMC)

The Duff Moisture Code is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth.
This code gives an indication of fuel consumption in moderate duff layers and medium-size woody material.
BC Wildfire Service uses this indice as a threshold for lightning caused wildfire starts.

### Drought Code (DC)

The Drought Code is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers.
This code is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and the amount of smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs.

### Initial Spread Index (ISI)

The Initial Spread Index is a numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread.
It is based on the wind speed and the Fine Fuel Moisture Code.
Like the rest of the Fire Weather Index system components, the Initial Spread Index does not take fuel types into account.
Actual spread rates vary between fuel types.

### Buildup Index (BUI)

The Buildup Index is a numeric rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion on the landscape.
It is based on the Duff Moisture Code and the Drought Code, thus considering the moisture content of medium-sized to large-sized woody material as well as the effects of seasonal drought on forest fuels. 
The BUI is used by the BC Wildfire Service to decide when to implement a campfire ban.

### Fire Weather Index (FWI)

The Fire Weather Index is a numeric rating of fire intensity.
It is based on the Initial Spread Index and the Buildup Index.
It is used as a general index of fire danger throughout the forested areas of British Columbia.

### Historical Weather

The BCWS Datamart is a public FTP site where external users can access weather station observations and fire weather indices for analysis or other similar needs.
The DataMart includes data from BCWS weather stations only. 
New files are published to the FTP site each day during the current year. 
Historical data files are also available for all previous years back to 1987. 
More information on both formats can be found in this document. <a href="https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/ftp/HPR/external/!publish/BCWS_DATA_MART/" target="_blank">DATA MART</a>
