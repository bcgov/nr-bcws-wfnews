### ![]( %my_location ) Near Me function

The near me function will provide a listing of all information available within a 50 KM radius of your location.
In order to use this function, location services must be turned on for this application. Click the Near Me tool.

When utilizing this service, depending on fire activity at the time, current prohibitions etc., this may take a couple seconds to process.
A list will result, and you can expand or collapse the screen.
Once the “x” is hit, it will clear the list.

### ![]( %search ) Search Location

The Search Location control at the top of the map allows you to search for a geo location within the Province of BC.
Simply start entering the character of your search.
The search results will show as you type.
When you find the location you are looking for, simply click on the card and the map will zoom to the given location.
This tool uses the BC Geolocation Service so it typically will not find things in other provinces or countries.
